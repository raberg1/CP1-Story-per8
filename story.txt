I woke up
I walked my dog Logan
I ate breakfast
I went to school
I went to period 1
I went to period 2
I went to period 3
I went to period 4
I went to period 5
In my 5th period class there was still no permanent substitute for my class so a lot of us did nothing.
I went to period 6
I went to period 7
I went to period 8
I sat through some amazing classes
I came home from school
I walked Logan again
I ate dinner
I went to sleep
