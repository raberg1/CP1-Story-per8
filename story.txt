I woke up
I walked my dog Logan
I ate breakfast
I went to school
I went to period 1
The class had a good dynamic.
They were very vibrant.
Everyone finished their work.
I went to period 2
We were supposed to have a test today.
"Oh, no! I forgot to study," the class including me exclaimed.
During taking the test, the fire alarm started blasting.
We ran out excited, knowing that we didn't have to finish the test.
It started snowing as I set foot in the cold.
The coldness of the snow was able to burn out the fire inside. "*WOW!*" we all yelled.
So we had to immdeaitely go bakc inside with enough time to finish the test.
As we miserably walked back into the school, a bird flew into the building.
It landed into the wall, and, on impact, triggered the fire alarm.
This time, the sprinklers started throughout the school.
We had to spend the rest of the period starting a fire to burn out the ice that was created.
At least, now I had time to study for the take makeup.
For 2nd period I took a quiz but then my dog came and ate my homework
I went to period 3
During third period, I had lunch. For lunch my friends and I went to starbucks. While they ordered drinks, I was busy doing my homework for tomorrow. 
I went to period 4
I went to period 5
I went to period 6
I went to period 7
Period 8 was fun. Programming is cool, Github is super fun!
I was flying in the sky with the wonderful birds and almost crashed into a building because mustard got into my eyes. I was then traumatized and had to go to the hospital for the night.
My day is over!
I sat through some amazing classes
I taught students about forks and how to do one
I came home from school
I had a snack
I did some homework
I walked Logan again
