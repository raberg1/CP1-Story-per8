I no longer wanted to teach the class. This class was sooooo boring! No one was talking and everyone was pretending I could not see them on their phones. So I decided to open my computer and sneak on my phone as well. I thought it was a great decision because by the end of the class I had binged watch the rest of RuPauls Drag Race
I sat through some amazing classes
I came home from school
I walked Logan again
I ate dinner
I watched a movie
I went to sleep
